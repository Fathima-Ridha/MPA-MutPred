### **Fathima Ridha**, **M. Michael Gromiha<sup>#</sup>**

---
We developed [MPA-MutPred](https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/MPA-MutPred/), a novel method specific for predicting the binding affinity change upon mutation (ΔΔG) in membrane protein-protein complexes.

## Usage Restrictions

The code has been provided for **academic purposes only**.

## Prerequisites

This program is developed using **Python 3** (>v3.8) and requires several Python packages to run. Please ensure the following packages are installed:

- **Bio**
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **scipy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pickle**
- **Generic libraries**: `sys`, `re`, `subprocess`, `os`, `collections`, ...

### Additional Software Requirements

- **Naccess (v2.1.1)**: Ensure you edit the Naccess executable file with the path of your local installation. You can download it from [Naccess](http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess/).

- **FoldX (v2024)**: Kindly install the FoldX software from [FoldX](https://foldxsuite.crg.eu/).
