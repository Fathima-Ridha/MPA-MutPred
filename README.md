### **Fathima Ridha**, **M. Michael Gromiha<sup>#</sup>**

---
We developed [MPA-MutPred](https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/MPA-MutPred/), a novel method specific for predicting the binding affinity change upon mutation (ΔΔG) in membrane protein-protein complexes.

## Usage Restrictions

The code has been provided for **academic purposes only**.

## Data

The sample datasets used for training and evaluating the models are provided in the `data` folder. If you wish to use your own data or the complete dataset, you need to prepare the datasets in the format provided for each case to train/test the models.

To access the complete datasets used in the study, please visit the [R-SIM database](http://your-database-link.com).

## Code Usage

Instructions on how to use the code are available in a `README.md` file within each folder (links provided below):
